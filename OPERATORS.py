# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# in the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values
print (10 + 2)


""" ARITHEMATIC OPERATORS"""
## Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations

print (10 + 2)
print (2 * 5)
print (10 - 5)
print (10 / 5)
print (11 % 2)      #11 goes in 2 table 
print (2 ** 6)        #  2 *2 *2 *2 *2


"""COMPARISION OPERATORS"""
#Comparison operators are used to compare two values
# COMPARE VALUES AND RETURN TRUE OR FALSE
print (10 == 10)
print (10 != 10)
print (11 > 10)
print (10 < 11)
print (10 >= 10)
print (10 <= 10)

"""LOGICAL OPERATORS"""
#means combine one or more experssions ( AND , OR ,NOT)
# AND = if both statements are true it will be true , one statement is false it will be flase
print (5 < 10 and 6 > 3)

# OR = if one statement is true all will be true
print (5 < 6 or 6 > 7)

# NOT = NOT statment reverse the result
# if statemnet is true it will show false, statement is false it will show true
print(not(5 < 10 and 6 > 3))

"""ASSINGMENT OPERATORS"""
# assining a value to variable

x = 5
print (x)

x = 5
x+=3
print(x)

x = 5
x -= 3
print(x)

x = 5
x *= 3
